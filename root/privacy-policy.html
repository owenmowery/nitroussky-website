                        &nbsp;
                        <p><strong>How we use cookies</strong></p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our App in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better App, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the App.</p>
                        &nbsp;

                        <p><strong>Links to other Apps</strong></p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>Our App may contain links to other Apps of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other App. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the App in question.</p>
                        &nbsp;

                        <p><strong>Controlling your personal information</strong></p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>
                        <li>Whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the App, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes</li>
                        <li>If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to us.</li>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.</p>
                        &nbsp;
                        <p>You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
                        &nbsp;
